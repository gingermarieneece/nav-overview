# Nav Overview

## Scenario
You're building an interactive editorial piece about cities around the world and want to include a navigation component that will allow the reader to learn about a different city. Create a simple, minimalist navigation bar based on the video example and JSON file provided. Match the design as closely as you can. The navigation bar should have a sliding bar that indicates a selected item, and that bar should resize itself to match the width of the selected item text.

- On resize, the sliding indicator bar should update its position and size to match the text.
- Code should be optimized for Safari. Support for other browsers is not necessary.
- Please limit library usage. ES6 and CSS as much as possible. SASS is permissible.
- You will have 24 hours to complete the exercise.

### Bonus
Display the current time of the selected city. You have creative license on how this should look and behave.
