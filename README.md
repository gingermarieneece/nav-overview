# City Navigation Overview

## Scenario
You're building an interactive editorial piece about cities around the world and want to include a navigation component that allows readers to learn about different cities. Create a simple, minimalist navigation bar based on the video example and JSON file provided. The navigation bar should include a sliding indicator that shows the selected item and resizes to match the width of the selected item text.

## Requirements
- The navigation bar must:
  - Update the sliding indicator's position and size to match the text on window resize.
  - Be optimized for Safari; support for other browsers is not necessary.
  - Limit library usage, using ES6 and CSS as much as possible. SASS is permissible.
- You will have 24 hours to complete the exercise.

## Bonus
- Display the current time of the selected city. You have creative license on how this should look and behave.

## Features
- Dynamic navigation items generated from a JSON file.
- A sliding indicator that reflects the currently selected city.
- Responsive design that adjusts on window resize.
- Current time display for the selected city.
